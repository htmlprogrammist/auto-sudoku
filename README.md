# Automated Sudoku

This project should help me remember how to work with functions and get more familiar with the Python programming language.

| Input | Output |
|:--|:--|
| Input | is done from the keyboard, using a space as a separator between the numbers in the string   |
|  | You also may use Google Spreadsheets (check the repository for the template file |
|  | And the last, but not the least, is web-page input |
| Output | is a `9x9` matrix, in which the result of the algorithm will be |
|  | If you use Google Spreadsheets, the algorithm outputs the values in cells K1:S9 |
|  | While using web-pages, it will show you answers in the table |

In this project, there are 3 main functions around which the project will be built:
- Check the vertical line
- Check the horizontal line
- Check the square

The algorithm will be implemented on a simple iteration of numbers (At least at the time of writing this README, and I hope I can find a better solution)
