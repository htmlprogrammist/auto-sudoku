# Automated Sudoku

This project should help me remember how to work with functions and get more familiar with the Python programming language.

Input is done from the keyboard, using a space as a separator between the numbers in the string  
Output is a 9x9 matrix, in which the result of the algorithm will be

In this project, there are 3 main functions around which the project will be built:
- Check the vertical line
- Check the horizontal line
- Check the square

The algorithm will be implemented on a simple iteration of numbers (At least at the time of writing this README, and I hope I can find a better solution)
